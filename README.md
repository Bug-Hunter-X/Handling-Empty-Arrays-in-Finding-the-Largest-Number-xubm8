# Handling Empty Arrays in Finding the Largest Number

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript when finding the largest number in an array, specifically when the array is empty or undefined.  The `getLargestNumberBug.js` file shows the initial flawed code. The improved solution is in `getLargestNumberSolution.js` and addresses this edge case.
